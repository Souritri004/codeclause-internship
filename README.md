# CodeClause Internship Projects

This repository contains two Java projects developed during my internship at CodeClause. The projects are:

1. Folder Locker
2. Time and Stopwatch

## Folder Locker

The "Folder Locker" project is a Java program that allows you to lock and unlock a folder by creating a hidden, locked version of the folder. It provides a command-line interface for locking and unlocking folders, and it prompts the user to enter the folder path and a password for access control.

To use the "Folder Locker" program, follow these steps:

1. Compile the Java source file: `javac FolderLocker.java`
2. Run the program: `java FolderLocker`
3. When prompted, enter the path of the folder you want to lock or unlock.
4. Enter a password for accessing the locked folder.
5. The program will lock or unlock the folder accordingly.

Please note that this program serves as a basic example of folder locking and should not be considered a highly secure solution.

## Time and Stopwatch

The "Time and Stopwatch" project is a Java program that provides functionalities for measuring time intervals and implementing a stopwatch. It consists of two classes: `Time` and `Stopwatch`.

The `Time` class represents a time duration and provides methods for adding, subtracting, and formatting time intervals. The `Stopwatch` class implements a stopwatch with start, stop, and reset operations.

To use the "Time and Stopwatch" classes, follow these steps:

1. Compile the Java source files: `javac Time.java Stopwatch.java`
2. You can import the classes into your own project or use the provided examples.
3. Refer to the class documentation and code comments for details on the available methods and their usage.
